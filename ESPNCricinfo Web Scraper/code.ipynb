      "Mathematically impossible unless there are extras now!Into the pitch outside off, looked like the slower one. Deepti slapped it in the air and top edged just past the ring. Long-on came in and stopped it.\n",
      "Yorker and all Deepti could do is drill it back to the bowler, 9 off 2 needed!It was just outside off, Deepti stayed leg side and smothered it right into the pitch\n",
      "Tight wide call, given! Back-of-hand cross seamer\n",
      "Dropped by McGrath at cover, that's probably the 11th for the day and could've closed out the game! She tried to take it above head, clasped at it and it burst through the hands.\n",
      "Deepti plinks the pull and they get only one!. Slow and very short, doesn't rise much though. Deepti went hard at the front-foot pull and got it to square leg\n",
      "Deepti makes room and thrashes it through extra. It was at the stumps but was too full, Deepti could get underneath and power a drive along the ground\n",
      "Harleen dances down and Gardner goes through her!Shortish ball at 87ks, Harleen still couldn't cope with the lack of bounce. She tried to turn it leg side and got nothing on it! Subdued celebration from Gardner, crowd goes quiet\n",
      "Makes room and cuts the length ball from around fourth to short third\n",
      "Makes room and slaps it hard but finds cover. Healy asks the fielder to \"hold it\", and that's what happens\n",
      "Looped up invitingly, beats the big swing. 75ks outside off on a fullish length, swpins away and Deepti can't connect with the slog over long-on\n",
      "Shortish ball at 81ks keeps low. Harleen goes back, gets low and clips it to midwicket\n",
      "Shortish ball outside off is belted straight to long-off\n",
      "Overpitched around off, driven straight to cover\n",
      "Wide on a length, 111ks, Harleen tries to cut it square and misses\n",
      "Pulled hard but can't clear deep midwicket. Slower one does the trick for Sutherland, back of hand into the pitch. It's cranked from outside off but the top edge finishes a few feet inside the ring. Gardner takes it above head.\n",
      "Can't thread through cover. Low fully outside off, was slapped hard. Litchfield dove to the left and half-stopped it.\n",
      "Full toss outside off, 111ks, cloths a heave across the line to long-on\n",
      "Full on fourth, whipped to midwicket. Sutherland bowling to the field, angling it in, not offering room\n",
      "Vastrakar wanted a single and is sent back. Dinked towards cover, fielder swooped in. Good call from Deepti\n",

      "Slow on a length outside off, Deepti dabs it to short third\n",
      "Beaten by bounce. Length outside off, 80ks, Deepti tried to dab it off the back foot with a cross bat\n",
      "Drives the full ball outside off through cover, fielder in the ring dives across but can't stop it. Goes to long-off\n",
      "Lifted over cover, not perfectly timed. Deep cover comes in and stops it. Was a fullish ball outside off, given some air, too much elevation off the bat\n",
      "Is there an edge?Big appeal for caught behind, not given. Australia reviewLength outside off, Vastrakar tried to push it to cover. Ultra-Edge shows there was an outside edge. But has Healy taken it cleanly? She leant forward and took it close to the ground. She tried to scoop it up with her gloves, the third umpire says it bounced, soAustralia lose the review\n",
      "Low full toss outside off is worked to midwicket\n",
      "Down leg this time. 113ks on a fullish length, angled in from around the wicket and went past the flick\n",
      "Wide and slow, just 86ks, it's on a length and Deepti has a whiplash off the slashing blade. Gets beaten and goes to the keeper on the bounce\n",
      "Spoons the fullish ball outside off from the inner-half of the bat, to long-on\n",
      "Low fully outside off, 114ks, helped away to deep forward square\n",

      "Pulls the shortish ball from off to deep midwicket\n",
      "Ghosh misses out on the hundred!She nailed the cover drive but the fielders were packed inside the ring. Litchfield moved to the left and intercepted the bullet while on the run. Ghosh smashes the turf with her bat in frustration. Was a length ball just outside off that she drove on top of the bounce. It went flat and around waist-height\n",
      "Pitched up from around the wicket, driven firmly to the right of mid-off. No direct hit at the non-striker's end, so the single is easy\n",
      "Yorker on leg, jammed to the bowler's right, Sutherland runs across but can't stop it leading it to a single\n",
      "Like the first ball, but it's further down leg. The back of hander goes wrong. Luckily for the bowler, it goes past the pull\n",
      "Cross-seam yorker around off, blocked in front\n",
      "Waits foe the slower one into the pitch and pulls it around the corner. Garth at short fine tried to stop it to the side but couldn't\n",
      "Turns the length ball drifting down leg to square leg\n",
      "Ghosh steps leg side, and Gardner goes for the wide yorker. The batter leaps across and manages to flay a square drive over the infield. Great flexibility, takes her into the nineties.\n",
      "Makes room and tries to go inside out. Gets the full ball high in the air and into the mid-off outfield.\n",
      "Spin again. Lands on a fullish length in line with the stumps and beats the outside edge as well as the off stump\n",
      "Nice bounce. Offbreak lands around fifth, turns away and Deepti goes for the square drive. Beaten\n",

      "Flicks the full ball at the stumps to long-on\n",
      "Full ball is knocked to mid-on for a single. Fielder jogged in from the deep, Deepti was keeping her in check, thinking about the second. But that's unlikely with the threat of Ghosh's cramps\n",
      "Shortish ball doesn't rise at all. It's slow, so Deepti has the time to wait for the late dab to short third\n",
      "Full around fifth, 109ks, driven to cover\n",
      "Waits a while for the slower bouncer and absolutely smashes it, finds deep midwicket. Great pull but the fielder was well placed\n",
      "Yorker around off, waits for ball to just pass her and jams it to point\n",
      "Spins away to beat the outside edge. Looped in on a fullish length around off, 79ks, Deepti tried to block it with a straight bat and that spun viciously to go past the bat's shoulder\n",
      "Helps the full ball on leg straight to short fine. 78ks, Deepti disappointed with the placement of that sweep\n",

      "Works the full ball from the stumps to the right of long-on\n",

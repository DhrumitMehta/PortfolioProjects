Having always been a fan of the IPL, I wanted to look at my favourite tournament from a new lens. Using Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, and Matplotlib, I extracted, analysed and visualized data to form some conclusions about the 2023 IPL season. Also, looking at the lack of quality statistical cricket analysis on YouTube, I decided to make videos based on my conclusions, such as: "IPL '23 Best XI (Data-Driven)".
